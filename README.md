# Memory Game 
Built with react native as an exercise to improve animation skills. 
This project uses the reanimated library to handle the animations.
Basicly you will be able to chose a deck, a dificulty level and start playing, at the 
end of the game you'll be given your results: the attempts you took to finish the game 
and the ratio of matches.

Enjoy it!
